New Courese i have started to learn java with spring and many more

After the jdk 9 we can run the java code with out creating the java file and we can do so by running the code in `java Shell` by running the following command on CMD:

```bash
    jshell
```

Diffrent types of Integers 

1. `Int` which have 4 bytes 
2. `long` which have 8 bytes
3. `short` which have 2 bytes
4. `byte` which have 1 byte which means it can store values between -128 to 127

Diffrent types of float

1. `float` which have 4 bytes
2. `double` which have 8 bytes

java by default support `double` for decimal values as it don't know the preciding values of an decimal value or it may be storing the scientific values

we need to tell the compiler explicitly that store this value as `float` by adding f at the end of the line.
