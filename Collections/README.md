# Collection 

We need to pass the datatype in the while defining the collection so that we can get compile time error not run time 
We can use List to do indexing of the data 
In list we can add same values but in set we can't

[Intro.java](First.java)

# Set

HashSet : not give the values in the same order it takes and not save the same value and also not sort the value so it is fast 

TreeSet : sort the value do some sorting in background so it is slow in terms of HashSet

If we want to use synchronized Map then we can use `HashTable` it provide the synchronization by default
